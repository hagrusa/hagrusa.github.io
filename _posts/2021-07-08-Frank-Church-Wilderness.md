In 2021, Archer and I did a 50+ mile backpacking trip through Idaho's Frank Church Wilderness, which is the largest contiguous wilderness area in the lower 48. We hiked out of the Salmon River Canyon, the second deepest canyon in North America, second only to Idaho's Hells Canyon! Over the entire 50 miles we did not encounter another person or human footprint. It was a bit lonely to be honest!
