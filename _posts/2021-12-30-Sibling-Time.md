We spent some quality time with my dad's dog and Archer's older sister Lulu. Lulu is ~6 months older than Archer and they share the same dad. We did a little bit of bird hunting, but mostly napped by the fire.

A very cold adventure in the Owyhee Mountains near the Oregon border. My Land Cruiser[^1] did great. I was able to drive through snow drifts as high as the front bumber without getting stuck (permantently stuck, that is!). Thank god for chains and 4 wheel drive.

It was 10 degrees outside but we were cozy sleeping in the car:
