I grew up near Boise, Idaho and earned my bachelorâ€™s degrees in physics and astrophysics from UC Berkeley in 2017. I started my Ph.D. at the University of Maryland shortly thereafter. My advisor is Professor [Derek Richardson](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~dcr/) and most of my research involves modeling the dynamical evolution of the Didymos binary asteroid before and after the DART impact.

My hobbies include fishing, camping, and wrenching on my car (although my hobbies change a lot...). Here's a picture of Steph and our dog, Archer, on the Salmon River in Idaho in July 2021. Most of my free time is spent spoiling Archer. He is a ~2 year old Blue Weimaraner. Although he was bred as a hunting dog, he spends most of his time honing his stick retrieving skills.
