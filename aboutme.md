I grew up near Boise, Idaho and earned my bachelorâ€™s degrees in physics and astrophysics from UC Berkeley in 2017. I started my Ph.D. at the University of Maryland shortly thereafter. My advisor is Professor [Derek Richardson](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~dcr/) and most of my research involves modeling the dynamical evolution of the Didymos binary asteroid before and after the DART impact.


At the time of this writing[^1], my hobbies include fishing, camping, and wrenching on my car. Here's a picture of Steph and our dog, Archer, on the Salmon River in Idaho in July 2021. Most of my free time is spent spoiling Archer. He is a ~2 year old Blue Weimaraner. Although he was bred as a hunting dog, he spends most of his time honing his stick retrieving skills.

In 2021, Archer and I did a 50+ mile backpacking trip through Idaho's Frank Church Wilderness, which is the largest contiguous wilderness area in the lower 48. Over the entire 50 miles we did not encounter another person or human footprint!

After recently buying a 20 year old Toyota Land Cruiser, I've become obsessed with DIY car repairs and maintenance. Here are some  -->
