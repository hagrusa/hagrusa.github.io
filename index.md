I am an astrophysicist and planetary scientist broadly interested in solar system dynamics and scientific computing. I recently received my Ph.D. from the [University of Maryland](https://www.astro.umd.edu/) where most of my research has focused on the dynamics of the binary asteroid Didymos in support of NASAâ€™s Double Asteroid Redirection Test ([DART](https://dart.jhuapl.edu/)) Mission. You can download my CV [here](pdfs/agrusa_CV_aug2022.pdf).
