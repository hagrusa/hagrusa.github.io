I am a 5th year Astronomy Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.astro.umd.edu/). Most of my research is focused on modeling the dynamics of the binary asteroid Didymos in support of NASAâ€™s Double Asteroid Redirection Test ([DART](https://dart.jhuapl.edu/)) Mission. However, I am also broadly interested in solar system dynamics, planetary defense, and scientific computing. You can download my CV [here](pdfs/agrusa_CV_May2022.pdf).
